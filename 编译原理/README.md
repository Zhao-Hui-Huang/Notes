LL vs LR

> At a high level, the difference between LL parsing and LR parsing is that **LL parsers** begin at the start symbol and try to apply productions to arrive at the target string, whereas **LR parsers** begin at the target string and try to arrive back at the start symbol.
>
> An **LL parse** is a **l**eft-to-right, **l**eftmost derivation. That is, we consider the input symbols from the left to the right and attempt to construct a leftmost derivation. This is done by beginning at the start symbol and repeatedly expanding out the leftmost nonterminal until we arrive at the target string. An **LR  parse** is a **l**eft-to-right, **r**ightmost derivation, meaning that we scan from the left to right and attempt to construct a rightmost derivation. The parser continuously picks a substring of the input and attempts to reverse it back to a nonterminal.

> **LR parsers** come in many flavors (LR(0), SLR(1), LALR(1), LR(1), IELR(1), GLR(0), etc.) and are far more powerful. They also tend to have much more complex and are almost always generated by tools like `yacc` or `bison`. **LL parsers** also come in many flavors (including LL(*), which is used by the [`ANTLR`](http://www.antlr.org/) tool), though in practice LL(1) is the most-widely used.
